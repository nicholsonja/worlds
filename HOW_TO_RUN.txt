1. Make the maze 

    ./make_maze.py 
        Creates a 3x3 maze with cell size 3

    ./make_maze.py ROWS COLUMNS CELL_SIZE
        Creates a ROWSxCOLUMNS maze with cell size CELL_SIZE

        For example:
            ./make_maze.py 5 5 2

2. Check the maze 

    gazebo maze_world.xml 
    
3. Open the maze with the turtlebot 

    roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo main.launch world_file:=`pwd`/maze_world.xml
    
3. Open the path with the turtlebot 

    export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=`pwd`/models
    roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo main.launch world_file:=`pwd`/path_world.xml


4. If playing with gazebo and want to use models in the models folder

	export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=`pwd`/models
	gazebo

5. To view camera
	
	start gazebo (#3)

	rviz -d camera.rviz

	# Can also run this command, but will need to set up camera
        # roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch
